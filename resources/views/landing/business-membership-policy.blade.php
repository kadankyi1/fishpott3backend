					located at fishpott.com (the "Site"). Our mission is to connect entrepreneurs ("Founders") who are working on  
					businesses ("Startups") with people who may be able to provide financing, advice and other support to those Startup ("Investors"). 
					Among other things, FishPot offers web-based tools to facilitate fundraising by Founders for their Startups. FishPot also provides 
					supplementary materials that educate both Founders and Investors about the nature of entrepreneurship, the process and perils of 
					private investing in companies. The services, features, content or applications that may be offered from time to time by FishPot in connection 
					with the Site and/or FishPot's business collectively referred to as the "Services."

                    By accessing the Site and/or using the Services, you agree to be bound by all of the provisions of the Terms of Service (the "TOS"). 
					IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND AGREE TO ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE TOS, OR IF YOU ARE NOT ELIGIBLE, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS THE 
					SITE OR USE THE SERVICES.
					This TOS provides that all disputes between you and FishPot will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO 
					TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract, except for matters that may be taken to small claims court. Your rights will 
					be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury, and your claims cannot be brought as a class action.
					As used in the TOS, the terms "you" and "your" mean each individual or entity that accesses, browses or uses the Site and/or the 
					Services in any manner. If you are accessing the Site and/or using the Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant 
					to FishPot that you have the authority to bind the entity you represent to the TOS. Your agreement to this TOS will be treated as 
					the agreement of the entity you represent.
					FishPot may modify the TOS or add or remove terms at any time, and each such modification, addition or deletion will be effective 
					immediately upon posting on the Site. Your use of the Site or the Services following any such posted modification, addition or deletion 
					constitutes your agreement to be bound by and your acceptance of the TOS as so modified. It is therefore important that you review the 
					TOS regularly. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS OF THE MODIFIED TOS, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS THE SITE AND/OR 
					USE THE SERVICES, AND YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE DOING SO.

            <p class="sample-text">
				
				<strong>15.1 Governing Law; Venue and Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong><br>
				The User Agreements shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Ghana, without regard to its 
				conflict of law provisions. If a lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under a User Agreement, then you and FishPot agree to submit to the 
				personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts located within Greater Accra, Ghana for the purpose of 
				litigating any dispute. EACH OF YOU AND FISHPOT HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY 
				IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY CLAIMS, COUNTERCLAIMS, CROSS-CLAIMS, OR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS) ARISING OUT OF, 
				UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY USER AGREEMENT. FURTHER, EACH OF YOU AND FISHPOT HEREBY CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OR AGENT OF THE OTHER 
				HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT THE OTHER WOULD NOT IN THE EVENT OF SUCH LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO JURY 
				TRIAL PROVISION. EACH OF YOU AND FishPot ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS SECTION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR EACH OF THEM, RESPECTIVELY, TO ENTER INTO THIS 
				TOS.
				
				<br><br><strong>15.2 Disputes With Other Users.</strong><br>
				You are solely responsible for your interactions with users of the Site and the Services, and any other parties with whom you interact on or 
				through the Site, the Services and/or the Linked Sites. FishPot reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with these 
				disputes.
				
				
				<br><br><strong>15.3 Dispute Resolution.</strong><br>
				15.3.1. Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and FishPot in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as 
				described in Section 15.3.2, you and FishPot agree that every dispute between you and any FishPot affiliate arising in connection with the User 
				Agreements will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator 
				instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. 
				Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of 
				or relating to any aspect of any User Agreement, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, 
				and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this TOS. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS TOS, 
				YOU AND FISHPOT ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
				
				
				<br><br><strong>15.3.2. Exceptions.</strong><br>
				Despite the provisions of Section 15.3.1, nothing in any User Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either 
				party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local 
				agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual 
				property infringement claim; or (e) pursue any available remedies under federal or state securities law.
				
				
				<br><br><strong>15.3.3 Arbitrator. </strong><br>
				 
				<br><br><strong>15.3.4 Notice; Process.</strong><br>
				A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified Mail (signature required) 
				or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail ("Notice"). 
				FishPot's address for Notice is: FishPot, Inc., C/11 Sraha-West, Ashaley Botwe, Greater Accra, Ghana. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and 
				basis of the claim or 
				dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if 
				the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or FishPot may commence an arbitration proceeding. 
				During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or FishPot must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator 
				makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, FishPot will pay you the highest of 
				the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by FishPot in settlement of the 
				dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (iii) GHS 1,000.
				
				 
				<br><br><strong>15.3.5. Fees.</strong><br>
				If you commence arbitration in accordance with this TOS, FishPot will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for 
				more than GHS10,000. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Greater Accra, Ghana, but if the claim is for 
				GHS 10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; 
				(b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established in Greater Accra, Ghana of your billing address. 
				If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, 
				then the payment of all fees will be determined by the Arbitrator. 
				In that case, you agree to reimburse FishPot for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay are determined by 
				the Arbitrator. 
				Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the 
				essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to 
				the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the 
				arbitrator's ruling on the merits.
				
				<br><br><strong>15.3.6 No Class Actions.</strong><br>
				YOU AND FISHPOT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER 
				IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and FishPot agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more 
				than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
				

				<br><br><strong>15.3.7 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</strong><br>
				If FishPot makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to FishPot's address for Notice, you may reject the change 
				by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to FishPot's address for Notice, in which case your account with FishPot will be 
				immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
				
				If Section 15.3.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 15.3 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this 
				Section 15.3 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 15.1 will 
				govern any action arising out of or related to any User Agreement.

            <br>

			<h4 class="mb-20">16. Indemnity</h4>
            <p class="sample-text">

				provisions which shall remain in full force and effect and (ii) shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary to comply with the 
				applicable law. FishPot reserves all rights in and to the Site, including the Services and the other content posted thereon, unless otherwise
